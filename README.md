# Warehouse Simulator

This project implements case 1 from group 4 _Warehouse Operations Simulation with Queue Management_ and on top of it group 6 case 3 _Parallel Processing for Simulation_.

It uses `ConcurrentSim` for the implementation of the DES and `DataFrames` for the output of statistical information to simplify post-processing and aggregation of simulation results.

## Warehouse Simulation Setup

Core of the simulator is the function `simulate_warehouse_queue(位_g, 位_f, p_g, p_f, Q_g, Q_f, n, duration)` taking the following input parameters as also specified in the case study:

- 位_g: arrival rates for groceries
- 位_f: arrival rate for frozen goods
- p_g: processing times for groceries
- p_f: processing times for frozen goods
- Q_g: queue size for groceries
- Q_f: queue size for frozen goods
- n: number of workers processing the items one at a time
- duration: duration of the simulation

To run the simulation, activate this project and run the following lines i.e. in the REPL:

```{julia}
using WarehouseSim

df = simulate_warehouse_queue(1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 0.5, 20, 20, 2, 100)
```

To set the loglevel or disable logging, the `Logging` package can be used:

```{julia}
using Logging

disable_logging(LogLevel(Logging.Info))
```
